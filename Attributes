//An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's opening tag.
//All attributes are made up of two parts − a name and a value
//Attribute names and attribute values are case-insensitive.

//The name is the property you want to set. 
//For example, the paragraph <p> element in the example carries an attribute whose name is align, which you can use to indicate the alignment of paragraph on the page.

//The value is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within quotations.
//For example: three possible values of align attribute: left, center and right.

//Code

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html>
 
   <head> 
      <title>Align Attribute  Example</title> 
   </head>
	
   <body> 
      <p align = "left">This is left aligned</p> 
      <p align = "center">This is center aligned</p> 
      <p align = "right">This is right aligned</p> 
   </body>
	
</html>

//Output

//This is left aligned
//                     This is center aligned
//                                            This is right aligned

//Core Attributes

//The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML elements (although not all) are
//  * Id
//  * Title
//  * Class
//  * Style

// Id Attribute

//The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML page.

//There are two primary reasons that you might want to use an id attribute on an element −

// If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier, it is possible to identify just that element and its content.
// If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet), you can use the id attribute to distinguish between elements that have the same name.

//Example 

<p id = "html">This para explains what is HTML</p>
<p id = "css">This para explains what is Cascading Style Sheet</p>

//The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element. 
//They syntax for the title attribute is similar as explained for id attribute 
//The behavior of this attribute will depend upon the element that carries it, although it is often displayed as a tooltip when cursor comes over the element or while the element is loading.

//Example 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

   <head>
      <title>The title Attribute Example</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      <h3 title = "Hello HTML!">Titled Heading Tag Example</h3>
   </body>
	
</html>

//Output

Titled Heading Tag Example

//Now try to bring your cursor over "Titled Heading Tag Example" and you will see that whatever title you used in your code is coming out as a tooltip of the cursor.

//The class Attribute

//The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class of element. 
//The value of the attribute may also be a space-separated list of class names.

//Example 

class = "className1 className2 className3"

//The style Attribute

//The style attribute allows you to specify Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) rules within the element.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

   <head>
      <title>The style Attribute</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      <p style = "font-family:arial; color:#FF0000;">Some text...</p>
   </body>
	
</html>

//Output

//Some text... (in red colour format)

//You need to understand what are HTML attributes and how they can be used while formatting content.

//Internationalization Attributes

//There are three internationalization attributes, which are available for most (although not all) XHTML elements.
// * dir
// * lang
// * xml:lang

//The dir Attribute

//The dir attribute allows you to indicate to the browser about the direction in which the text should flow. 
//The dir attribute can take one of two values, as you can see in the table that follows −

//ltr ->	Left to right (the default value)
//rtl	 -> Right to left (for languages such as Hebrew or Arabic that are read right to left)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html dir = "rtl">

   <head>
      <title>Display Directions</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      This is how IE 5 renders right-to-left directed text.
   </body>
	
</html>

//Output

                            .This is how IE 5 renders right-to-left directed text
                            
//When dir attribute is used within the <html> tag, it determines how text will be presented within the entire document.
//When used within another tag, it controls the text's direction for just the content of that tag.

//The lang Attribute

//The lang attribute allows you to indicate the main language used in a document, but this attribute was kept in HTML only for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of HTML.
//This attribute has been replaced by the xml:lang attribute in new XHTML documents.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">

   <head>
      <title>English Language Page</title>
   </head>

   <body>
      This page is using English Language
   </body>

</html>

//Output

//This page is using English Language

//The xml:lang Attribute
//The xml:lang attribute is the XHTML replacement for the lang attribute. 
//The value of the xml:lang attribute should be an ISO-639 country code
