//Heading Tags
//Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings.
//HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the elements <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>.
//While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.

//Code 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

   <head>
      <title>Heading Example</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      <h1>This is heading 1</h1>

      <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
      <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
      <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
      <h6>This is heading 6</h6>
   </body>
	
</html>

//This is heading 4 (h4 format)
//This is heading 5 (h5 format)
//This is heading 6 (h6 format)


//Paragraph Tag
// The <p> tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs.
// Each paragraph of text should go in between an opening <p> and a closing </p> tag 

//Code

      <title>Paragraph Example</title>

   </body>
	
</html>

//Output

//Here is a second paragraph of text.
//Here is a third paragraph of text.

//Line Break Tag
//Whenever you use the <br /> element, anything following it starts from the next line.
//This tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them.
//The <br /> tag has a space between the characters br and the forward slash.
//If you omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you miss the forward slash character and just use <br> it is not valid in XHTML.

//Horizontal Lines
//Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections of a document.
//The <hr> tag creates a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks the line accordingly.
//Again <hr /> tag is an example of the empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them.
//The <hr /> element has a space between the characters hr and the forward slash.
//If you omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the horizontal line, while if you miss the forward slash character and just use <hr> it is not valid in XHTML

<!DOCTYPE html>

//Output
//This is paragraph one and should be on top
//............................................
//This is paragraph two and should be at bottom

//Preserve Formatting
//Sometimes, you want your text to follow the exact format of how it is written in the HTML document.
//In these cases, you can use the preformatted tag <pre>.
//Any text between the opening <pre> tag and the closing </pre> tag will preserve the formatting of the source document.
